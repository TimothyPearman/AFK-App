app that moves your mouse randomly if you are afk to get around work surveillance :D

to build the app:
you must first change directory to the folder that holds the .py and .ico files
- cd "C:\Users\Corsair\Downloads"
then you need to run the command 
- pyinstaller -F -w -i [icon name].ico [name of the app].py
